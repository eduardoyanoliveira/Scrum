# Quality in Scrum

* ## Testing is done often, not just at the end

Test is done during the sprints, when the product is been delivered.

* ## Not just the responsibility of one person

Quality is a responsibility of everyone, not only of the QA or the Tester.

* ## Meets standards does not seek perfection

There is no need to over engineering the product, or waste a long time seeking for perfection.

* ## Continuous imrpovement 

It is a scrum ritual to look the retrospective, to reflect about improvement to next sprint.
