# Planning in Scrum

Plannign in Scrum like a lot of things in scrum is done continuosly during the product/service development.Usually done after the end of a sprint and before the start the another.
So It's possible to say that unlike other projects methodologies that planning is done in a certain stage, scrum planning is iterative.

## Sprint planning

* Plan what can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?

* How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?

* Sprint planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

* Development Team explains to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work to accmplish the Sprint goal.

* Plan based on priorities from the backlog.
