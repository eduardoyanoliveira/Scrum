# Scrum Pilars

* ## Transparency

In a scrum project the work done by a professional must be transparent and visable to other people involved or effected by the project. During the product development time, there are always diferent types of stakeholders that need be up to date of the project's progress and at what stage it currently is.
In the scrum everybody knows what is being done, what are the pendencies and what is the queue of execution of the work.

* ## Inspection

The current work (scrum artifact) is always being inspected to review progress and what has been changed.

* ## Adaptation

When the feature being developed is not anymore the desired result, adjustments can be made during the process to aim the result with what is desired. And if also something is not working well it can be adapted, there is no need to wait for the end to discuss the fixes or what can be improved.
