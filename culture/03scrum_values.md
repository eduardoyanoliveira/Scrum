# Scrum Values

* ## Commitment

If a team member has to delivery something, this person has to be fully commited in delivering at time and on budget.

* ## Courage

Courage in scrum is thinking outside the box, is to be coraged enough to change things that are not working in the process. Even if the complete process has to change, in order of the fully commitiment with the delivery result.

* ## Focus

Focus on the short time delivery has totally to do with the commitment.In order to improve or create something faster and better, apply maximum possible focus on it will always be the best way.

* ## Opennnes

Very closely realated to transparency, a person that works with scrum really need to be open about what is being done, in which way and using which tools.

* ## Respect

Respect is maybe the biggest value. It's really necessary to be open to others ideas. And if the idea can improve the development proccess, the scrum team will apply it right away, without wait for the next stop.

### Scrum is a culture!
