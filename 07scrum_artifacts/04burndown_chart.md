# The Burdown Chart

&nbsp;The Burndown chart allows to see how much work is remaining and the progress made between sprints.

* The X axis displays the Sprint number.

* The Y axis displays the amount of story points remaining to be done.

&nbsp;To get the progress done between the Sprints, it's only need to subtract the remaining amount of story points in a Sprint to another.For example the amount of Sprint one minus the Srpint two amount.
