# Overview

## Introduction

Scrum is an agile method used to improve the project creation and as well the implemantation of features.

## Summary

* ### Quick delivery with a focus on value; customer centric:

A Scrum team is always focused on delivery or add value to the company's stakeholders (usually the customer), and to do so, the team works with a specific goal during a short amount of time (The sprint). 

* ### Iterative and cotinuos work:

In Scrum, the work is iterative and continuos and that means that instead of trying to build something and then moving to another thing, the scrum team works on top of the things that have already been deliveried. Eveything is continous, testing; planing; delivering; etc.
A Solution is delivered every time.

* ### Scope is negotiable:

If something is need to be added or changed from the feature or project, it can be discussed and it is more likely to happen than a fixed scope project. The Project is always avaliable to adjusts.

* ### Continuos improvement:

Like the last subject says, the Scrum team is always looking for improvements during the development process.

* ### Frequent Testing:

Testing is not done during phases, but continuos.

* ### Traditional roles are blur:

People do not stick strictly to their roles. The tester can help to do something that is not test. The developer can do help designer work. This are just some examples.
