# The Product Owner

The Product Owner ussualy is a person from the business, and he/she represents the customer and stakeholders in a scrum project.He/She defines the product in customer centric terms prioritizing based on importance and dependencies. A Scrum Team should have only one Product Owner, but a person can be the Product Owner for more than one team.
The Product Owner is a bridge between the team and stakeholders and because of that he/she can not be also the Scrum Master.He/she steers direction of what is being delivered, and negotiates priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.
