# Delivering in Scrum

The Delivering proccess in scrum is done iterativly. The Scrum team will deliver after each sprint a solution to the user story, that does not mean that the first deliver will be the best product, the Scrum team can deviler a basic solution and start work on top of it.

## Improving in Scrum:

Improving Scrum is made by retrospectives, by analizing what has been done, what can be improved, what went wrong in the proccess.

### A real file exmaple:

To Examplify the delivering process we can think in cake factory that uses scrum to create new cakes. Let's see the Scrum sprints as a ordered list.

1. The Scrum team makes a dough recipe and bakes a mini sample.
    * The Scrum team realize that the dough is not in a good consistency. So, the recipe is changed.
2. After baking a new sample a cake cover is added.
3. The Scrum team fills the cake with chocolate.
4. The recipe and all the additional parts of the cake is delivered to the cooks.
